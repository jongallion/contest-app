<div class="ContestDetails">
  <h1>Welcome to the Contest Example</h1>

  <p>If this is your first time here this week, you should see the contest modal, and have an entry in the contest table.</p>
  <p>If you have been here before today, you will not see the modal or get another entry in the table.</p>
  <p>If you have been here before this week, you will not see the modal, but will get another entry in the table.</p>
  <p>Each day you'll be entered into the table, and each week you will see the modal once each week.</p>
  <p>You can clear the cookies to see the modal again, but this won't create an extra entry in the table.</p>
